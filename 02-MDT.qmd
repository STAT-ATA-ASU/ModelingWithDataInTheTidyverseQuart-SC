# Modeling with Basic Regression

Equipped with your understanding of the general modeling framework, in this chapter, we will cover basic linear regression where you will keep things simple and model the outcome variable y as a function of a single explanatory/ predictor variable x. We will use both numerical and categorical x variables. The outcome variable of interest in this chapter will be teaching evaluation scores of instructors at the University of Texas, Austin.
